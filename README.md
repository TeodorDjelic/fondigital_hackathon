## Problem

Make NIS' [Drive Go](https://www.nisgazprom.rs/en/petrol-stations/applications/drive-go/) application more interactive and fun while waiting for the car's fuel tank to fill up, which can take from 30 seconds up to 3 minutes. Try to also make it rewarding for the  user.

## Our solution

While waiting for the fuel to fill up, user can control a virtual car that can be driven around lanes, goal being to collect various NIS affiliated branding items. After the user's car fuel tank fills up to the desired level, user is redirected to pay for the fuel, aswell as visually showing the gained coins from the minigame, which can be redeemed for rewards. Rewards span NIS affiliated branding items, which can be claimed at any [NIS Petrol and Gazprom](https://www.nisgazprom.rs/en/) petrol stations in Serbia.
